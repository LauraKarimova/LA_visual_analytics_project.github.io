		<p style="font-weight: bold;">WHO AND WHAT IS OUR TOOL FOR? </p>
		Our tool is designed for a wide range of users, including:
		<ul>
			<li>Researchers</li>
			<li>Policy makers</li>
			<li>Healthcare professionals</li>
			<li>General public</li>
		</ul>

		<p style="font-weight: bold;">WHAT THE TOOL SHOWS? </p>
		Webpage presents visualizations on abortion rates and deaths caused by abortions in different countries and regions. It shows the number of abortions of different types (safe, less safe, and least safe) for different regions of the world, such as Africa, Latin America, Asia, Europe, and Oceania. The tool also presents data on the rate of deaths caused by abortions of these types in these regions. 
		<br>
		<br>
		The tool presents a comprehensive analysis of data on abortion rates, safety, costs and mortality rate caused by abortions in different countries and regions. It helps to understand the correlation between the cost of abortion services and the rate of deaths caused by abortions, and it may also help to identify areas where further research or policy changes could improve accessibility and safety of abortion services.

		<p style="font-weight: bold;">DATA </p>
		In this research, we used the <a href="https://osf.io/m85s9/">Adding It Up All Women Data Set</a> obtained from the website of the Guttmacher Institute, which is a leading research and policy organization committed to advancing sexual and reproductive health and rights (SRHR) worldwide.
		<br>
		<br>
		From the data presented, we used:
		<ul>
			<li>number of abortions of three types (safe, less and least safe) (in whole numbers)</li>
			<li>deaths caused by abortions (percentage)</li>
			<li>prices for abortion and post-abortion care services (U.S. dollars)</li>
		</ul>
	</div>
	<hr>
	<div style="margin-left: 25px; margin-right: 25px;">
		<p style="font-weight: bold;">LIMITATIONS</p>
		The main limitation of our tool is that the data we used does not have information for all countries of the world, that is, we were able to analyze only for the available countries.

			</p>
			<p>
				Looking at the pie chart, the first thing you can notice is that the largest number of all abortions among these regions occurs in Asia. In addition, in Asia and Latin America, more abortions are classified as less safe, in Africa and Oceania as unsafe, while in Europe they are classified as safe.

					A choropleth map shows the death rates caused by unsafe abortions (less safe and least safe) for different countries.

				These stacked bar charts show the costs of abortion services and post-abortion care services for different regions of the world and for the three types of abortions (safe, less safe, and least safe). Each bar represents a region, with the height of the bar indicating the total cost of the services in that region and the sections or stacked layers within the bar representing the cost of each type of abortion. The charts allow for easy comparison of the total cost of the services and the relative proportion of each type of abortion across different regions.

			<p>
				In this table, we have presented the costs of abortion services in general, the cost of safe and unsafe abortions for all countries.
				<br>
				<br>
				If we look at prices specifically in the countries of Libya and Sudan, what we see is that in Sudan, abortion services are almost 4 times more expensive than in Libya. Whereas for both countries, the prices for less safe abortions are 2 times lower than safe ones, therefore, most likely, people resort to the first type more often. That is, in Sudan, abortions of any kind are much more expensive, but the death rate from abortions in the country is lower.
