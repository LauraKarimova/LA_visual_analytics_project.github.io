### WHO AND WHAT IS OUR TOOL FOR?

Our tool is designed for a wide range of users, including:
  - Researchers
  - Policy makers
  - Healthcare professionals
  - General public

### WHAT THE TOOL SHOWS?

Webpage presents visualizations on abortion rates and deaths caused by abortions in different countries and regions. It shows the number of abortions of different types (safe, less safe, and least safe) for different regions of the world, such as Africa, Latin America, Asia, Europe, and Oceania. The tool also presents data on the rate of deaths caused by abortions of these types in these regions.

The tool presents a comprehensive analysis of data on abortion rates, safety, costs and mortality rate caused by abortions in different countries and regions. It helps to understand the correlation between the cost of abortion services and the rate of deaths caused by abortions, and it may also help to identify areas where further research or policy changes could improve accessibility and safety of abortion services.

### DATA

In this research, we used the Adding It Up All Women Data Set obtained from the website of the Guttmacher Institute, which is a leading research and policy organization committed to advancing sexual and reproductive health and rights (SRHR) worldwide.

From the data presented, we used:
  - number of abortions of three types (safe, less and least safe) (in whole numbers)
  - deaths caused by abortions (percentage)
  - prices for abortion and post-abortion care services (U.S. dollars)

### LIMITATIONS

The main limitation of our tool is that the data we used does not have information for all countries of the world, that is, we were able to analyze only for the available countries.
