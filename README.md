# WHAT THE TOOL SHOWS?

Webpage presents visualizations on abortion rates and deaths caused by abortions in different countries and regions. It shows the number of abortions of different types (safe, less safe, and least safe) for different regions of the world, such as Africa, Latin America, Asia, Europe, and Oceania. The tool also presents data on the rate of deaths caused by abortions of these types in these regions.

The tool presents a comprehensive analysis of data on abortion rates, safety, costs and mortality rate caused by abortions in different countries and regions. It helps to understand the correlation between the cost of abortion services and the rate of deaths caused by abortions, and it may also help to identify areas where further research or policy changes could improve accessibility and safety of abortion services.
